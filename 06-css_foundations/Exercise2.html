    <h1>From Garden to Plate</h1>
    <p>
      A <em>potager</em> is afrench term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen.
      Often flowers (edible and non-edible) and herbs are planed with the
      vegetables to enhance the garden's beauty. The goal is to make the
      function of providing food aesthetically pleasing.

    <h2>What to plant</h2>
    <p>
      Plants are chosen as much for thier functionality as for thier color and
      form. Many are trained to grow upward. A well-desgined potager can provide
      food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintinance.
      Potagers can disgusie their function of providing for a home in a wide
      array of forms - from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the
      formatlity of a knot garden
