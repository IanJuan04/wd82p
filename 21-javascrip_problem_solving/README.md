# Problem Solving

1.  Unerstand the Problem
2.  PLan

    - Algorithim => Pseudocode
    - Pseudocode:
      1. Kapag ang user ay nagtpe ng number
      2. Mag create ng variable kung saan ilalagay natin ang value ng zero
      3. mag create pa ng isang variable na mag hohold ng value na nilalagay ni user
      4. Habang mas mababa ang counter variable

3.  Divide and conquer

## Solving Fizz Buzz

Write a program that takes a user's input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

1. Plan

   - There's an input to collect the number from user
   - The desired output is a list of numbers
     from 1 to the number that the user entered.
     But for numbers divisible by 3, print Fizz.
     But for numbers divisible by 5, print Buzz.
     But for numbers divisible by both, print FizzBuzz.
   - Pseudocode:
     1. When a user unputs a number
     2. Loop from 1 to the entered number
     3. If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
     4. If the current number is divisible by 5then print "Buzz"
     5. If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
     6. Otherwise print the current number
